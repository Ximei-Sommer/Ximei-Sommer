âœ… ***In this blog, I will introduce the paper "ProVe: A pipeline for automated provenance verification of knowledge graphs against textual sources". ProVe consists of a pipelined approach that automatically verifies whether a Knowledge Graph triple is supported by text extracted from its documented provenance. ProVe is intended to assist information curators and consists of four main steps involving rule-based methods and machine learning models: text extraction, triple verbalization, sentence selection, and claim verification.***
